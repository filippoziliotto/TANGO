I will provide examples of Pseudo-code program in response to given questions. For each new question, generate ONLY the related Pseudo-code program, given the examples you saw. Use only the functions that you have previously encountered.

Question: search for the laptop
Program:
# search for the laptop
explore_scene()

    return ans

Question: which room is the dining table located in?
Program:

    return ans

Question: what color is the sink in the kitchen?

        ans = answer("what color is the sink?")
        return ans

Question: is the table in the bedroom made out of wood?
Program:
# search for the bedroom
explore_scene()
bedroom = detect("bedroom")

if is_found(bedroom):
    # search for the table
    explore_scene()
    table = detect("table")

    if is_found(table):
        # answer the question
        navigate_to(table)
        ans = answer("is the table made out of wood?")
        return ans

Question: Where can I wash my hands?
Program:
# search for a sink
explore_scene()
sink = detect("sink")

if is_found(sink):
    # answer the question
    navigate_to(remote)
    ans = answer("which room is the sink located in?")
    return ans

Question: How many lights are above the bathroom mirror?
# search for the bedroom
explore_scene() 
bathroom = detect("bathroom") 

if is_found(bathroom): 
    # search for the mirror in the bathroom
    explore_scene(bathroom) 
    mirror = detect("mirror") 

    if is_found(mirror): 
        # navigate to it and count how many lights
        navigate_to(mirror) 

        # look up above the mirror
        look_up()
        lights = detect("light") 
        n_lights = count(lights)
        ans = eval(" '{n_lights}' if {n_lights} > 0 else '0' ") 
        return ans

Question: Find my laptop and check if there is free space on the table to put it,  if not leave try to check the couch
Program: 
# search for the laptop
explore_scene() 
laptop = detect("laptop")  

if is_found(laptop): 
	# search for the table
    explore_scene() 
    table = detect("table") 

    if is_found(table):
        # answer the question
        navigate_to(table) 
        ans = answer(“is the table free?”)

        # If yes return answer
        if eval(“True if ‘yes’ in {ans} else False”): 
            return ans

		# if no search for the couch
        explore_scene() 
        couch = detect("couch") 
        if is_found(couch):
            # navigate to it and terminate episode
            navigate_to(couch) 
            return
