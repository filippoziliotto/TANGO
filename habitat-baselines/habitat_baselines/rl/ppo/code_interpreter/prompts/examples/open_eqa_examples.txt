I will provide examples of Pseudo-code program in response to given questions. For each new question, generate ONLY the related Pseudo-code program, given the examples you saw. Use only the functions that you have previously encountered.

Question: How many lights are above the bathroom mirror?
Program:
# search for the bedroom
explore_scene() 
bathroom = detect("bathroom") 

    if is_found(bathroom): 
        # search for the mirror in the bathroom
        explore_scene(bathroom) 
        mirror = detect("mirror") 

        if is_found(mirror): 
	        # navigate to it and count how many lights
            navigate_to(mirror) 

            # look up above the mirror
            look_up()
            lights = detect("light") 
            n_lights = count(lights)
            ans = eval(" '{n_lights}' if {n_lights} > 0 else '0' ") 
            return ans
